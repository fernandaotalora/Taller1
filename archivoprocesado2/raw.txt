economic spotlight   italian boom italy  strong economic revival has ledsome observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in somequarters about future growth prospects  but many italianexperts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive      i think all this foreign interest in the so called italianmiracle is really exaggerated   foreign observers alwaysoscillate in the case of italy between complete pessimism andunwarranted optimism   says luigi spaventa  one of italy leading economists and a professor at rome university     according to spaventa  these violent swings of mood havebeen occurring for the last    years  with italy one minuteseen as the  bad boy of europe  and unable to raise a dollar andthe next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration      i think there  a lot of exaggeration   once it used to bethe underground economy and all the correspondents of foreignnewspapers flocked to italy to study this  that was anotherstory about nothing   like writing about a black cat in a darkroom      spaventa  in tune with other economists and industrialistshere  stress italy  recent achievements  particularly thedramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrialenterprises  but warns that the economy is still vulnerable      profits of private sector firms such as fiat s p a    are booming  themajor state industries are back in the black after years oflosses  inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance ofpayments deficits have been slashed  expectations by someexperts that italy is poised to replace britain as the world fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism     italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what itfeels to be its second rate status among the majorindustrialised countries     only this week  it angrily demanded clarification of thisstatus after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministersfrom the group of five  g      comprising the united states japan  west germany  france and britain     italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated anagreement reached in tokyo last year to let italy and canadaattend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concernedmanaging the international monetary system     but italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problemsstill facing its economy  economists and industrialists say      we must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy  warns fiat managing director cesare romiti     he says that while italy  recent achievements are indeedcause for satisfaction and optimism  the focus now should be onthe problems still remaining rather than those already solved     the country  huge state sector deficit  high unemploymentand a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the mostworrying problems  experts say     the size of the state spending deficit    estimated at        billion lire in      and targetted at         billionlire this year    means there is a risk inflation could spiralagain  says carlo scognamiglio  head of the private luissuniversity in rome     inflation fell into single digits for the first time in adecade in september      and by january this year was runningat     pct  but it is still not low enough to guaranteeinternational competiveness  economists and industrialists say     and unemployment was running at      pct nationally lastoctober according to the latest official data     recent official data showed that of a total      millionpeople seeking work in october       almost    pct were agedbetween    and     unemployment in the south was running at     pct  more than double that in the industrial north     the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd  recently forecast that italian gross domestic product gdp  would rise rise three pct in      after expanding     pctin       but it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough tocheck rising unemployment     another problem is italy  reliance on imported rawmaterials  the country imports around    pct of its fuel needs     this factor actually worked sharply in italy  favour lastyear  when lower energy costs helped slash the country  tradedeficit to       billion lire  by year end from        billionlire in          but economists say the improvement owes little to anystructural change in the italian economy and that any reversalof the trend in costs could have serious consequences     if italy truly wants to be counted among the world  topindustrialised nations  it also needs to tighten up stockmarketoperating procedures and encourage firms to supply more qualityinformation about their activities  economists say     italy has no controls on insider trading     the country also needs to shed its rigid capital movementscontrols    a european community directive calls for these tobe dismantled by         but this too will require a lessblinkered attitude and a change in traditional operatingprocedures  economists say      even today  if i wanted to invest in the tokyo bourse  idoubt i  find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in bankswhich would allow me to do that   says spaventa
